# Kiva Analysis

## Introduction

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand what factors impact how quickly borrowers raise money for microfinance loans. "Microfinance" refers to a system of relatively small loans (typically < $5000 USD), made to individuals or small groups with less access to traditional banking in developing countries to promote entrepreneurship or activity in various economic sectors. This project uses data from Kiva, one of the largest and most open microfinance insitutions to use web-based crowd-funding to finance its loans. On Kiva, borrowers have a web-page describing themselves and what they intend to use the loan for, allowing prospective lenders to lend a portion (or all) of the loan amount requested. Kiva makes available a large number of fields on each loan, and this analysis is interested in understanding what impact gender, loan sector (i.e, agriculture, industry, etc), and geography have on how quickly a loan is raised.
